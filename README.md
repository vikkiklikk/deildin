CRUD Web app designed as an eSports web application for Dota 2 tournaments.

Backend - Flask connected to Supabase

Frontend - React

This project is a part of the Vefskóli/Tækniskóli corriculum and is an individual project coded and designed by Viktor Birgisson.

I chose the python backend to prepare for an internship at Síminn as well as React.

We've been working a lot with Next but I wanted to get more familiar with React without the Next framework and I have not made a CRUD app with a python backend so far.
